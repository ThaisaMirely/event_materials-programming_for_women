:warning: important points:

- turtoriais some materials may contain pictures and most often license associated with them . Read before use them;
- another important thing is not to use the material for commercial purposes. Most were made to free events (I think all), so we will not ' break ' the principle of use. OK? :thumbsup: :bowtie:
